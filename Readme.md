# eggd_confirmation_thresholds

## What does this app do?

Takes a pair of VCFs, one from hap.py and the other from Sentieon (the former must be generated from the latter) and a list of QC metrics. Produces an HTML report showing the distributions of all the requested metrics, split by True/False Positive status. Use to determine QC thresholds at which Sanger confirmation of variants may be skipped. 

## What are the inputs?
- Truthset VCF generated by hap.py
- Matching sample VCF generated by Sentieon
- List of VCF QC metrics

## What are the outputs?
- Interactive HTML report with multiple distribution plots per metric.

## Where is this app applicable?
For any assay/pipeline that generates GIAB or similar hap.py & variant call VCFs
